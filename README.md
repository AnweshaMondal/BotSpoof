🤖 BotSpoof – Rule-Based Chatbot

BotSpoof is a full-stack chatbot application built with the MERN stack, designed to simulate conversational AI by matching user queries with pre-defined responses. It demonstrates how rule-based NLP systems work, combining a clean UI, modular backend, and database-driven logic to deliver a functional chatbot with fallback handling.

✨ Key Highlights

💬 Rule-Based Chat System – Matches user queries against a database of ~500 predefined Q&A pairs.

❓ Fallback Handling – Returns a fallback response for unknown questions (achieving ~90% answer coverage in testing).

📂 Persistent Data – Stores and retrieves conversations using MongoDB.

🖥️ Responsive Frontend – Interactive chat interface built with React + Tailwind CSS.

⚙️ Modular Backend – API endpoints for fetching, storing, and logging conversations.

📊 Scalable Design – Easy to extend with new Q&A pairs or integrate with NLP/AI engines in the future.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Frontend: React.js, Tailwind CSS
Backend: Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB
Logic Layer: Rule-based matching (keyword & phrase matching)
Tools: Git & GitHub, Postman

📸 Project Showcase

✨ Core Features (screenshots can be added later):

🗨️ User-friendly chatbot interface

🔎 Query-to-response matching logic

❌ Fallback message handling for unknown inputs

📊 Database-driven knowledge base (~500 Q&A pairs)

🌟 Why This Project Stands Out

Demonstrates my ability to design a full-stack chatbot system from scratch.

Showcases knowledge of information retrieval, rule-based NLP logic, and conversational flows.

Implements a scalable architecture → future-ready for AI/NLP integration.

Built with a production mindset → modular backend, responsive frontend, persistent database.
